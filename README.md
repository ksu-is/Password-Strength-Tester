# Password-Strength-Tester
Webpage using flask to determine if strength of your passwords is adequate. Will recommend how to increase the strength of password given if it is found to be weak.


For my python project, I will be creating a webpage that allows you to input a password and check if the password is strong enough. If the password does not contain special characters (*,#,&,/,etc.), a mix of letters (caps and lower case) and numbers, it will notify the user and recommend what they should add to their password to make it stronger.

I believe this type of technology will is invaluable for today and the future. As technology advances, so do the ways people may take advantage of outdated password strategies. It is important now more than ever to create and use strong and unique passwords across all accounts. A mix of characters, letters, and numbers ensure a password is unguessable and extremely difficult to crack. 

Code of this nature can be used by young and old, and help instill the habit of making sure a password is strong for years to come.  I am a firm believer in password security, and with a simple check, users can easily learn if their password habits are reasonable, or if there is room for improvement.  It is always better to be safe than sorry, and as we go about our lives, creating new accounts, it is essential to make sure none of your accounts on any site are susceptible to an individual hack.
