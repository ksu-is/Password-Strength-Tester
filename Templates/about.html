    <h1>This page will tell you about the password strength tester!</h1>
    <p>The password strength tester takes any password you input and tells you if it is strong enough to protect your accounts!</p>
    <p>This tool is useful for the technological age and enforces good password practices.</p>
    <p>A score under 15 is weak.</p>
    <p>A score over 15, but under 25 is good.</p>
    <p>Any score above 25 is a great password, great job.</p>
